<h2 align="center">About</h2>
<p>Orbital is meant to be a powerful, yet simple 2D and 3D game engine. It started as a C++ and Direct3D project, though I decided to move it to Java and LWJGL. The engine is under development and all support/and or contribution is very welcome!</p>

<h2 align="center">How to use it</h2>
<p>Setting Orbital up is pretty simple. To set up Orbital you need to: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Clone the repository into a folder.</li>
    <li>Open it with your IDE or Code Editor of choice (personally, I use IntelliJ Idea)</li>
    <li>Run the `Main.java` file.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<p>Do note that Orbital is in its early development stages, so there isn't really much you can do with it. At the time of writing, you can render a window and get mouse input. If you want to make any sort of game using Orbital currently, you need to do all the logic in the loop function of the window class. </p>

<h2 align="center">Help</h2>
<p>If you have any inquiries or want any help about the engine, feel free to contact me on discord! My user tag is #6799 and my username is Yeff-Chan. You can also visit the support server, which is linked at the top of this readme.</p>
